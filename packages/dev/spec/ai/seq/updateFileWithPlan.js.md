# updateFileWithPlan.js

This module exports a single function `updateFileWithPlan` that takes a file path and a plan object as arguments, and updates the file according to the plan.

## Function Signature

```javascript
async function updateFileWithPlan(filePath: string, plan: object): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

- `filePath` (string): The path of the file to be updated.
- `plan` (object): The plan object containing the instructions for updating the file.

## Description

The `updateFileWithPlan` function reads the file at the given `filePath`, applies the changes specified in the `plan` object, and then writes the updated content back to the file.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const filePath = './src/someFile.js';
const plan = {
  insert: [
    { line: 5, content: 'console.log("Hello, World!");' },
  ],
  delete: [
    { line: 10 },
  ],
};

await updateFileWithPlan(filePath, plan);
```

In this example, the function will insert the content `console.log("Hello, World!");` at line 5 and delete line 10 of the file located at `./src/someFile.js`.

## Implementation Details

The function uses the Node.js `fs.promises` API to read and write files. It reads the file at `filePath` and parses it into lines. It then applies the `insert` and `delete` operations from the `plan` by inserting and removing lines. Finally, it writes the updated lines back to the file.
