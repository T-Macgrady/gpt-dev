# code2spec.js

This module provides the functionality to generate a spec file from a given source code file.

## Functions

### `code2spec(filePath: string, options: object)`

This function takes a file path and options as input and generates a spec file based on the source code file.

#### Parameters

- `filePath` (string): The path of the source code file.
- `options` (object): An object containing options for the code2spec process. The following options are supported:
  - `outputDir` (string): The directory where the generated spec file should be saved. Defaults to the current working directory.
  - `overwrite` (boolean): Whether to overwrite an existing spec file if it exists. Defaults to `false`.

#### Returns

- `Promise<void>`: A promise that resolves when the spec file has been generated.

## Usage

```javascript
const { code2spec } = require('./code2spec');

(async () => {
  await code2spec('./src/ai/call/jsonArrayChatCompletion.js', {
    outputDir: './specs/ai/call',
    overwrite: true,
  });
})();
```

## Implementation

This function uses the `aiBridge` module to analyze the source code file and generate a spec file from it.

It does the following:

1. Reads the source code file using `fs.promises.readFile()`
2. Parses the source code using `aiBridge.parseCode()`
3. Extracts the module name, functions, function parameters, and function descriptions from the parsed code
4. Generates markdown for the spec file based on the extracted information
5. Writes the markdown to the spec file using `fs.promises.writeFile()`

If an existing spec file exists and `overwrite` is `false`, the function will resolve immediately without overwriting the file.
